# Machine-learning-application-in-cancer-prognosis

Thank you for taking time to looking at this project. I have started working on this project to show my skills in python programming and machine learning.

This project is far from frinished but I will be regularly updating it with new analysis until it is done.
The aim of this project is to build  machine learning algorithms to predict progression free interval for colorectal adenocarcinoma patients.
The results shown here are in whole based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga.

I am planning to use a gene and clinical signature to predict colorectal adenocarcinomal prognosis using support vector machine, artificial neurat networks
and random forest.
I will be sequentially adding new analysis and planning to be done by the end of the December 2021.
This project is not part of my PhD  and therefore can only alocate a part of my time to it.

I hope you like it and welcome any constructive feedback.
